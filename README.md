This is the branch for Yuki v2.0, a WIP complete rewrite for Yuki.

-----

**Current Features**

- Russian Roulette
- Various commands for affection!
- Polling
- View server information
- Shake an 8ball


Because 2.0 is a *complete* rewrite, work on adding commands might be a bit slow. I've switched over from using Discord.Commands to using Qmmands, so there might be things I need to reimplement.

**To redo**
- Scramblr
- Moderation commands
- Many utility commands
- Custom commands
- Assignable roles


**Planned New Features**
- Guild settings panel
- Warnings, with customizable actions
- Reminders
- Leveling system
- Weather
- Timed mutes
- Pokemon info
- Steam status
- Twitch live notifications
- Advanced custom command system


If you have any feature requests, please join the Discord and mention them!
